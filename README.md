# Escape The Belladonna

This game was made over the course of 4 months as a part of the Northwest Missouri State University Foundations of Game Development class. It was contributed to by Daniel Crowley, Jacob Daleske, and Turbo Mair.

Escape the Belladonna is an adaptation of a board game designed by the "Sapphire Serpents" of the protech writing class at Northwest. The goal of the game is simple: Be the first player out of 4 to escape.

You begin the game at the top of the map, farthest from your exit. In order to escape you first need to collect a Small Key. In order to collect this small key, you will need to land on a Golden tile in order to trigger the Maze Minigame. Once in the Maze minigame, you will need to navigate a randomly selected maze from 1 of 5 mazes to find the key. You have 2 minutes to find it.

Once you have collected this small key, you need to try this small key at one of the smaller doors scattered across the board. If you choose the right door, you will be given the key to the Belladonna, and you will be able to escape.



# Tiles on the Board

Red tiles are simple ground tiles and have no effects. 

Blue tiles will give you a randomly selected map to 1 of the 5 mazes

Grey tiles will reset your position to the starting position

Purple tiles will take away one of the maps you have collected. If you have not collected any maps by landing on Blue tiles, then it will reset your position to the starting position

Golden tiles will trigger the Maze minigame, in which you navigate a maze to find the key to a room of the Belladonna, which will help you find the true key so you can escape.
